        "Averaging validation accuracy across multiple splits, often referred to as cross-validation, can indeed provide more consistent and reliable results compared to using a single validation split. Cross-validation is a common technique in machine learning and statistics used to assess the performance of a model and mitigate the potential impact of randomness in data splitting.\n",

        "Better Generalization: Cross-validation allows you to assess how well your model generalizes to different subsets of your data. This is particularly important when you have a limited amount of data, as it helps ensure that your model isn't overfitting to a specific validation set.\n",

However, it's important to note that the estimated test accuracy obtained through cross-validation is still an approximation of the true test accuracy that you would obtain on unseen data.\n",

        "More Stable Estimate: Increasing the number of iterations in cross-validation tends to yield a more stable and reliable estimate of your model's performance. This is because you're averaging the results from multiple validation sets, reducing the influence of randomness in the data split.\n",
